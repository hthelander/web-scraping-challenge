# web-scraping-challenge
Websites https://redplanetscience.com and
 https://data-class-mars-challenge.s3.amazonaws.com/Mars/index.html
 were scraped for news articles and weather data, respectively.  The data was formatted as a python list and, in the case of the weather data, a pandas database which was exported into a CSV file.  In the case of the data from the Mars weather website, data was also massaged to create visualizations for succinct review of the data presented in the table.
